# Git & GitHub
**Git:** Git is the free and open-source distributed version control systems thatâ€™s responsible for everything GitHub related that happens locally on your computer.
**GitHub** GitHub is a widely-used Free-to-use cloud Storage platform with version control and many other essential features that specifically helps developers to manage and deploy their projects on GitHub.
**Version Control** Version control, also known as source control, is a system that helps us manage changes to files over time. It keeps a detailed history of all modifications, so we can track what has changed, when, and by whom. This is especially useful for collaborative projects, where multiple people may be working on the same code or documents simultaneously.
