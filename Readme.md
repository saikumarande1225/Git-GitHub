# Version Control

Version control, also known as source control, is a system that helps us manage changes to files over time. It keeps a detailed history of all modifications, so we can track what has changed, when, and by whom. This is especially useful for collaborative projects, where multiple people may be working on the same code or documents simultaneously.

### Key Benefits:
- **History and Backups**: Every change is recorded, allowing us to go back to previous versions if needed.
- **Collaboration**: It helps multiple people work together without overwriting each other's changes.
- **Experimentation**: We can create different versions (branches) to test new ideas without affecting the main project.
- **Offline Work:** Git works offline, which means you can commit changes and work on your project even without an internet connection.
